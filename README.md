# rock-paper-scissors

This is my solution to the third project in The Odin Project's 'Foundations' course in web development. Here, I utilize basic concepts of Javascript - functions, variables, conditionals, scope, and events - to create a rock-paper-scissors game. I also practiced writing pseudocode for the major functions of the project, and refactoring code to incorporate new features (restructuring the game to be played in a UI instead of the browser console.)

To improve on at a later date: commenting, fixing newlines in final message.
